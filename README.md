## üéÆ About the game
Project developed together with two other colleagues and great friends, <i><a href="https://github.com/LucasGJ0">Lucas Guedes</a><i> and <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/andreyclemes/">Andrey V. Clemes</a> (Instagram)<i>, in mid-2016 at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Ararangu√° campus. Initially, the game was designed to use Dijkstra's algorithm as artificial intelligence. However, due to some problems, the idea was left out and it was decided to make a simpler system. 

## ‚ùì How it works?
The game developed is a tribute to the classic "Pacman", the main difference is in the way the ghosts chase the pacman in the maze. In fact, the maze was built to be the closest to the original. The objective of the game remains the same: go through the maze, eating the points, without getting caught by any of the enemies. When eating all the points in the scenario a message is displayed and the game is finished. However, if any of the ghosts collide with the pacman, the game ends instantly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To compile the game correctly, it is recommended to use Code :: Blocks version 12.11, and use the Allegro library version 4.4.2. However, if you just want to run the game, just clone this project and run the .exe file by accessing the "Release" folder in the "bin / Release / Pacman - Allegro Library.exe" path.

## üöÄ A little more
The project has not been updated since the university. Thus, a refactoring process will be necessary, as well as the updating of the Allegro library, in addition to the application of best practices on the C language.
